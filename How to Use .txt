How to Use

Follow these steps to run Tracker.exe:

Turn Off Windows Defender
First, turn off Windows Defender because it might detect and delete this tool.

Open Start menu, search for "Windows Security."

Go to "Virus & Threat Protection" > "Manage Settings" and turn off Real-time protection.

Open CMD or PowerShell as Admin
You need to run Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell as Administrator.

Search for "cmd" or "powershell" in Start menu.

Right-click and select "Run as Administrator."

Go to the Tool’s Folder
In CMD or PowerShell, go to the folder where Tracker.exe is saved.

Example: If the file is in C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\PakSIMTracker, type:

cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\PakSIMTracker

Run the Tracker for One Number
To track a single SIM number, use this command:

Tracker.exe -num <SIM_NUMBER>

Replace <SIM_NUMBER> with the SIM number you want to track.

Example: Tracker.exe -num 03001234567

In a few seconds, you’ll see the owner’s name, ID card, address, and other details on the screen.

Track Multiple Numbers with -l Flag
To track multiple SIM numbers at once, create a demo.txt file with a list of SIM numbers (one number per line). Then use the -l flag:

Tracker.exe -l demo.txt

Example: If demo.txt has numbers like:
03001234567
03123456789
03331234567

The tool will search all numbers in the list and show the data (owner’s name, ID card, address, and linked SIMs) for each number in order on the screen.
